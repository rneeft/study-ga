Feature: AbstractGraphCompareEngine

Background:
Given an initial abstract state n11 in graph 1 with the following data
    | Name    | Value    |
    | stateId | abc12345 |
And another abstract state n12 in graph 1 with the following data
    | Name    | Value   |
    | stateId | abc5678 |
And an egde e12 in graph 1 to connect verteces n11 and n12 with the following data
    | Name     | Value   |
    | actionId | zxy1234 |

Given an initial abstract state n21 in graph 2 with the following data
    | Name    | Value    |
    | stateId | xyz12345 |
And another abstract state n22 in graph 2 with the following data
    | Name    | Value   |
    | stateId | xyz5678 |
And an egde e22 in graph 2 to connect verteces n21 and n22 with the following data
    | Name     | Value    |
    | actionId | abc12345 |

Given an initial abstract state n31 in graph 3 with the following data
    | Name    | Value    |
    | stateId | abc12345 |
And another abstract state n32 in graph 3 with the following data
    | Name    | Value   |
    | stateId | 1234567 |
And an egde e32 in graph 3 to connect verteces n31 and n32 with the following data
    | Name     | Value    |
    | actionId | abc12345 |

Given an initial abstract state n41 in graph 4 with the following data
    | Name    | Value    |
    | stateId | abc12345 |
And another abstract state n42 in graph 4 with the following data
    | Name    | Value   |
    | stateId | 1234567 |
And an egde e42 in graph 4 to connect verteces n41 and n42 with the following data
    | Name     | Value    |
    | actionId | abc12345 |
And another abstract state n43 in graph 4 with the following data
    | Name    | Value   |
    | stateId | 9876543 |
And an egde e43 in graph 4 to connect verteces n41 and n43 with the following data
    | Name     | Value    |
    | actionId | poiu1233 | 

Scenario: Initial states are marked as corresponding states
For this test we use two graph that do not have a similar action id 
Given graph 1 as the old graph
And graph 2 as the new graph
When the comparison between the new and old graph has run
And the comparison result is merged
Then the merge contains 3 abstract states and 2 abstract actions
And the initial abstract state has the following data
    | Name               | Value    |
    | CD_CorrespondingId | abc12345 |
    | CD_CO_stateId      | abc12345 |
    | CD_CN_stateId      | xyz12345 |

Scenario: The same action id markes the target states as corresponding states
Given graph 2 as the old graph
And graph 3 as the new graph
When the comparison between the new and old graph has run
And the comparison result is merged
Then the merge contains 2 abstract states and 1 abstract action
And abstract state with stateId 1234567 has the following data
    | Name               | Value    |
    | CD_CorrespondingId | xyz5678  |
    | CD_CO_stateId      | xyz5678  |
    | CD_CN_stateId      | 1234567  |
And abstract state with stateId xyz5678 is not included in the merge graph

Scenario: A new state is merged as such
In graph 4 a new start (9876543 - n43) has been added
Given graph 3 as the old graph
And graph 4 as the new graph
When the comparison between the new and old graph has run
And the comparison result is merged
Then the merge contains 3 abstract states and 2 abstract actions
And abstract state with stateId 9876543 has the following class
    | ClassName     |
    | New           |
    | AbstractState |
    | NewVersion    |

Scenario: A removed state is merged as such
In graph 4 the state (9876543 - n43) has been added, so taking graph 3 al new graph
this will generated the removal of mentioned state
Given graph 4 as the old graph
And graph 3 as the new graph
When the comparison between the new and old graph has run
And the comparison result is merged
Then the merge contains 3 abstract states and 2 abstract actions
And abstract state with stateId 9876543 has the following class
    | ClassName     |
    | Removed       |
    | AbstractState |
    | OldVersion    |
