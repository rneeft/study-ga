\chapter{Terminology}

\textit{namespace}. In .NET namespace are used to create a set of corresponding objects. It is the Java counterpart of a package. In Java it is required that all the files in a package are in the same folder, this is not a requirement in .NET and file can therefore be scattered throughout folders. 

\textit{assembly}. In .NET an assembly is a collection of compiled types and resources, like files and images, that are combined into a single file \cite{assembly-net}. Assemblies are in two types of files, a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) and a executable. A .NET solution can exist out of multiple projects each creating its own type of assembly. A project can also use multiple assemblies. An assembly in Java can be compared with the \verb|JAR| file.
