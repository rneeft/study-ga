\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I want to thank my supervisors, Pekka Aho, Fernando Pastor Ric√≥s and Tanja Vos, for the opportunity and support of my graduation project. The weekly meeting and feedback were always inspiring and gave me good directions on what to do. I am grateful for allowing me to develop the application in C\#. Besides academic learning, using C\# and Blazor is extremely helpful in my day-to-day carrier.

Thanks to F-secure, especially Joona Oikarinen and Tatu Aalto, for their input and feedback regarding the Analysis website and the docker setup.

I want to thank my wife for her support in the process and for allowing me to sit in our home office for countless hours. 

Thank you to my family, and special thanks to my mother, who always supported me and pushed me to achieve my life goals. 

Last but not least, I want to thank my employer, VECOZO, for providing me with the resources to finish my Masters.
