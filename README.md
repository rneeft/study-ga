This git repository contains all the files corresponding to the Graduation Assignment.

## About the project
The topic of my project is [TESTAR](https://testar.org/). TESTAR (Or TEST*) enabled you to test your software's Graphical User Interface automatically. It will discover the GUI and executes test cases. 

## Structure of the repository
- The **thesis** folder contains the files for my research proposal. The document will be written in LaTeX. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is used for writing the thesis.
- The **.github/workflows** folder contains files for automating the document creation. Every week a release will be created with the current state of the research proposal.
